Idda: A circular knitting machine
==================

Reverse engineered from the [Addi Express](https://www.google.no/?#q=addi+express).

Features

* 22 or 46 needle. 
* Can create circular and rectangular swatches (using back-and-forth knit)
* Max swatch for 46 needle: 17.75 inch
* Manual cast-on and bind-off
* Manual forwarding

Motivation

* Be able to replicate using distributed digital manufacturing (3d-print/CNC)
* Be able to customize. Different number of needles, needle/mask size, adapting to different materials, adding automation

**Paused**

The [Circular Knitic](http://www.varvarag.info/circular-knitic)
[(Github)](https://github.com/var-mar/circular_knitic)
[(docs)](http://issuu.com/marcanet/docs/circular_knitic_documentation)
is an open source functional implementation of the same mechanism as Idda.

We propose that further development is done as improvements to the base provided by the Circular Knitic.
For instance allowing it to be:

* Configured for different sizes
* Be reproducable with only one digital fabrication machine (need only 3d-print OR laser/CNC)
* Use less special parts (like steel needles and aluminum profiles)
* Improve the portability

There are some FreeCAD source files included here.

## Teardown

Of a cheap China clone from China.

`TODO: post pictures/video`

* Mechanical principle
* Needle guide
* Stopper for plain-knit

## Mods

### Crank motor attachment

Status: **Proof-of-concept**. [Video of initial test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loaOWbuzrhs).

TODO: 

* Use a pulley with belt (or thread!) to connect
* Add a hand-crank on outside of pulley, so manual operation still possible
* Design connector for stepper-motor

[FreeCAD source](./motorattach.fcstd)|

The bevel gear was created using the FreeCAD macro/workbench [FCGear](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Macro_FCGear).


### Ideas

* 3d-printable replacement needles
* End-stops for crank-motor, to support automated plain-knitting
* Automated swapping of thread, by fusing/tying one yarn to another.
* Programmable moving of thread guide position. For automatic cast-on/off.
If able to manipulate 2 threads can do color patterns (like Fairisl).

## Alternate uses
... apart from creating clothing.

Light-weight construction tubes/trusses using polyester/epoxy resin. Possibly these could be continiously 'extruded',
by having the knitted thread be soaked/sprayed with resin right after being knitted. Then solidifying,
possibly assisted by heating to ~60 deg C.

Fiber for strengthening custom parts. For instance, using vacum-bagging.

Probably requires using a high-strength fiber like nylon, linen, jute, slik, fiberglass or carbon fiber.
Perhaps one can knit braided / multifilament fishing line (PE, nylon or fluocarbon),
thought these may have coatings that prevent resin filling?. They are cheap, and looks to be available up to 1-2 mm thickness.
Examples of carbon fiber yarn is [Zoltek PX-30](http://zoltek.com/products/panex-30/yarns/), and glass fiber is
